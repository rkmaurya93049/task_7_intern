# task_7_intern
in this i train two model for prediction of 'breast_cancer' using svm one uses  is 'linear kernel'  and other is 'non_linear kernel' for the prediction.there were alot of outliers present in data so i handle the outlier for better prediction and I also used the cross_val_score for determining the model peromanece.
